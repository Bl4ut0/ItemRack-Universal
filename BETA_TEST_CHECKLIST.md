# ItemRack Beta Regression Checklist

Use the packaged build from `.versions/Release/v{Version}`. Reload the UI after installation and test with Lua errors enabled. Capture `/itemrack dump` output whenever a failure occurs.

## Supported-client smoke matrix

Use the same universal archive for every row; do not build or test separate Forever and TBC packages.

- **Classic Era/Hardcore/Season of Discovery:** load both addon modules, open Options, equip a partial set, test a stance event, and inspect `/itemrack dump` version fields.
- **Burning Crusade Classic Anniversary:** test dual-spec transitions, duplicate enchanted/gemmed items, fast multi-slot swaps, and AutoQueue.
- **Forever/Camelot:** open Equipment Manager and ItemRack menus, test movement/mount events, specialization labels, item discovery, and the set-icon picker.
- On every client, confirm the TOC version, `ItemRack.Version`, and `ItemRack.BuildID` identify the same candidate.

## 1. Tooltip safety and layout

- Enable **Show set info in tooltips** and place one item in multiple saved sets.
- Hover that item in equipped slots, bags, the bank, and an ItemRack flyout.
- Confirm every expected set name appears, the tooltip backdrop contains the lines, and character-sheet flyouts do not overlap the tooltip.
- Immediately hover and use several Blizzard action-bar buttons. Record any `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED`, `SetShown`, `SetAttribute`, or `GameTooltip` error.

## 2. Rune-specific copies (Season of Discovery)

- Prepare two copies of the same base item with different runes and save each in a different set or queue position.
- Put a migrated legacy base-ID entry before those rune-specific entries. Confirm automatic and manual cycling prefer the exact worn/candidate rune and never stall on or equip an arbitrary wildcard copy.
- Equip each set, swap paired ring/trinket slots, and test a main-hand/off-hand shuffle.
- Physically swap between the two rune variants and confirm the normal equip hold/penalty is recorded; re-engrave the currently equipped copy and confirm that operation alone does not manufacture a physical equip transition.
- Re-engrave one equipped slot while another rune-bearing slot changes. Confirm only the engraved slot adopts the new rune identity and the physical swap keeps its normal hold, regardless of which inventory event appears first in diagnostics.
- Confirm ItemRack chooses the saved rune, reports the correct set as equipped, colors tooltip rows correctly, and does not silently accept the other rune.
- Test a bound weapon-only set during combat. If the secure macro cannot distinguish the copy, confirm the mismatch remains queued and resolves after combat instead of disappearing. Check duplicate enchants/gems and paired main-hand/off-hand moves; capture exact item links and client build if any action fails.
- With **Swap set weapons during combat** off, a full-set hotkey must wait until combat ends. Turn it on: weapons must equip immediately and armor only after combat. Repeated combat presses must keep equip intent rather than schedule unequip. Disable it during combat and confirm protected button configuration changes only after combat ends. Rune-specific and empty weapon slots must remain deferred.
- On Forever, open the icon picker then scroll/hover Blizzard Options > Advanced and check for taint errors. Enable floating combat text and both cooldown notification options; verify notices work without Lua errors, with and without optional chat output.
- Repeat one saved set created before rune metadata existed; it should retain legacy base-item fallback.

## 3. Event ownership and same-spec re-enable

- Manually equip a set that is also assigned to an event, then disable that inactive event. The manually equipped set must remain equipped.
- Activate an event normally, disable it while active, and confirm its stack layer unwinds once.
- Disable and re-enable the specialization event for the current spec without changing specs. Its assigned set should evaluate immediately.
- Manually equip the current specialization's assigned set, enable its event, then switch specializations. The event must not claim or later unequip the manually owned set unless it actually created an event-stack layer.
- Disable and re-enable the global event system while remaining in the same spec. Confirm specialization, stance, zone, and buff state are reconciled without duplicate swaps.
- Add a one-shot Script event triggered by `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, cross a loading screen, and confirm it runs exactly once after the transition hold with its original arguments.
- On a Shaman, enable the default stance-1 Ghostwolf event and assign a visibly different set. Enter Ghost Wolf, including on a client where `GetNumShapeshiftForms()` returns 0; confirm gear swaps and the Ghostwolf frame appears in the dump. Leave the form and confirm the prior set and per-set queues restore.
- Assign the same travel set to Ghostwolf and movement-gated Mounted above an enabled specialization event. Enter Ghost Wolf, mount and move, then leave Ghost Wolf while Mounted still owns the set. Confirm no premature restoration; stopping movement must finally restore the specialization set and its queue context. Repeat with PvP exclusions enabled.
- On a Druid, test numeric Bear/Aquatic/Cat/Travel defaults and named Moonkin/Tree events for the forms the character knows, including a non-English client. Test a custom event using the localized form name. Confirm entering/leaving forms changes and restores only the expected owned slots.
- For two same-base ring/trinket copies with different enchants or gems, save the exact later-slot copy alongside an earlier variant that is no longer carried. Keep a compatible spare available. Confirm the early slot receives the spare while the later slot receives its exact saved copy, and repeat with that exact copy already equipped.

## 4. Script event approval and mutation

- Create a valid custom Script event in ItemRack. Confirm **Save** immediately approves and enables it without a second prompt.
- Enter a syntax error in a new Script event and click **Save**. Confirm ItemRack refuses the save and leaves the editor open for correction.
- With another test addon or `/run`, add a Script event directly to `ItemRackEvents`, open the event list, and toggle it on. Confirm a warning identifies the event and trigger and the script cannot run before acceptance.
- Reject that warning. Confirm a new external event is removed; for an altered approved event, confirm the last approved source is restored disabled.
- Repeat and choose **Approve & Enable**. Confirm that exact source runs and remains approved after `/reload`.
- Alter one character after approval and fire the trigger. Confirm ItemRack reports and disables the event without executing the altered source, and logout/reload cannot persist the altered source.
- Confirm unchanged packaged Script events remain usable, while changing both the live event and public default table does not manufacture bundled trust.

## 5. Lock, summon, and transition recovery

- Trigger a one-item and a multi-item set swap while rapidly mounting/dismounting, accepting a summon, or crossing an instance portal.
- Confirm automatic swaps pause through the transition and resume after settlement without an internal bag error or permanent `SetsWaiting` state.
- While an item remains locked, issue multiple automatic requests and finish with one manual set click. Confirm older automatic work is discarded, the latest manual request receives one bounded retry, and persistent failure produces a clear chat message.
- Queue a request, then begin a channel lasting longer than ten seconds after the inventory unlocks. Confirm the watchdog waits for casting to end instead of reporting `None locked` or canceling the request.
- After a forced timeout, confirm the minimap/set display reconciles to the gear actually worn.

## 6. Right-click precedence

- With **Menu on Right-Click** on, confirm right-click opens the flyout.
- With it off and **Use on Right-Click** on, confirm right-click uses the equipped item.
- With both off, confirm right-click advances to the next valid queue item.
- Confirm slot 20 opens the set list only when **Menu on Right-Click** is enabled; Alt+Right-click must always open the Sets options tab.

## 7. Keybindings

- Bind, overwrite, and unbind both a set and a slot. Test a set name containing `%`.
- Confirm rejected overwrites restore both prior bindings, screenshots and extended mouse buttons remain protected, and deleting a set removes its binding.
- Test a bound weapon set both in and out of combat.

## Report data

Include the client branch/build, addon version, reproduction sequence, expected and actual set names, relevant item links/runes, full Lua error text, and `/itemrack dump` output.

## Candidate package verification

- Confirm the in-game version is the requested stable candidate and matches both addon TOCs.
- Confirm the reported candidate commit and SHA-256 match the staged package manifest.
- Confirm the exact staged package was installed into every detected target client and that installation fails rather than succeeding silently when no target exists.

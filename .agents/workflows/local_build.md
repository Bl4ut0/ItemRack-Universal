# Local Build and Installation Workflow

Use this workflow to validate and install the current `dev` source without creating a release.

1. Confirm the checkout is on `dev` and inspect `git status --short`.
2. Run the complete validation suite:

   ```powershell
   npm.cmd test
   ```

3. Ask before replacing any installed addon folders. After approval, install the source tree:

   ```powershell
   & .\.tools\install_local.ps1 -SourceRoot . -Confirm:$false
   ```

4. The installer must report at least one destination or fail. Verify every reported client folder contains both addon TOCs and Lua files. Do not commit local game files or generated `.versions` artifacts.

For release testing, use `.agents/workflows/release.md`; it installs the immutable staged release rather than the mutable source checkout.

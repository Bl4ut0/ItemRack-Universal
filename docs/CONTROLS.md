## ⚙️ Relevant Options

## 🔄 Auto-Queue System

The Auto-Queue system automatically swaps items based on cooldown availability:

1. **Enable Queue**: Alt+Left-Click a slot button, or use the Queue tab in Options
2. **Configure Priority**: In the Queue tab, rank items from highest to lowest priority
3. **How it works**: When an equipped item goes on cooldown, ItemRack swaps to the next ready item
4. **Pause Queue**: Check "Pause Queue" on items to prevent them from being swapped out during use
5. **Per-Set Queues**: Gear Sets automatically save and recall which slot queues are currently enabled when you equip them

---

## ⚡ Combat Queue

If you try to swap items while in combat, ItemRack will:
1. Queue the swap for when combat ends
2. Show a small overlay icon on the slot button indicating what's queued
3. Automatically perform the swap when you leave combat

Weapon-only saved-set keybindings equip immediately through a secure action.
Enable **Full-set hotkeys swap weapons in combat** under Global Settings to give
full-set keybindings the same immediate weapon action; the remaining gear
finishes after combat. This applies only to saved-set keys assigned with the
Sets-tab **Bind Key** button. Flyout-menu selections, `/itemrack equip` macros,
events, and queue requests use the deferred planner. Combat key presses equip
rather than toggle. Rune-specific or empty-slot weapon requests also defer.
Changes to the option during combat apply when combat ends. Character-sheet and
quick-access slot overlays show each still-unmet item from a bound set request;
an overlay clears when that exact item is observed equipped or the request ends.

## 📝 Notes

- Most actions that modify buttons or swap gear are **blocked during combat** due to Blizzard's secure action restrictions
- The "Set Button" (slot 20) appears when you Alt+Click the character model frame
- Hidden items can still be seen by holding Alt while hovering over menus (if AllowHidden is enabled)
- TrinketMenuMode combines both trinket slots into a single menu for easier management
